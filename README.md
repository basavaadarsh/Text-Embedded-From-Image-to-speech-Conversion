About:                                                   
 This project focuses on the conversion of text from images into speech, generating audio output. Through advanced image processing techniques, the system seamlessly extracts textual content from images and utilizes sophisticated speech synthesis technology to convert it into high-quality audio output. The objective is to enhance accessibility and provide a user-friendly solution for converting visual text information into a more universally accessible auditory format.
